# Testicular Cancer Germ Cell Analysis

This project classifies testicular cancer subtypes (Seminoma vs. Non-Seminoma) using gene expression data from the TCGA-TGCT dataset. It was completed as part of the CSE 428 Computational Biology Capstone at the University of Washington.

###  Overview
- Objective: Predict whether a patient's tumor is a seminoma or non-seminoma based on transcriptomic data.
- Dataset: TCGA-TGCT (Testicular Germ Cell Tumors), subset of 150 patients with transcriptome profiling (FPKM values).
- Labels: Each patient has a `is_seminoma` boolean label.

### Methods
Gene expression features were preprocessed by filtering the top N most variable genes.

Five classification models were trained and evaluated:
- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Cross-validation was performed (typically 5-fold) using Precision-Recall AUC (PR AUC) as the key metric.

Experiments varied gene count (top 100, 500, 1000, 2000) and data splits (75/25, 80/20).

### Results

Best performance (~0.95 PRAUC, ~93% Test Accuracy) was observed with the top 500 genes, 80/20 split, and 4–5 fold cross-validation. Logistic Regression, SVM, and MLP classifiers consistently achieved higher PRAUC across trials.

### Future Work
- Expand hyperparameter search and try more expressive models using libraries like PyTorch.
- Explore alternative gene expression metrics or other TCGA data modalities (e.g., methylation, copy number).
- Address data limitations and scalability for larger genomics datasets.
